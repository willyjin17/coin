## Updated RPCs

- `getnetworkinfo` now returns two new fields, `connections_in` and
  `connections_out`, that provide the number of inbound and outbound peer
  connections. These new fields are in addition to the existing `connections`
  field, which returns the total number of peer connections. (#19405)
