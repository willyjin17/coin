/** A key from a CWallet's keypool
 *
 * The wallet holds one (for pre HD-split wallets) or several keypools. These
 * are sets of keys that have not yet been used to provide addresses or receive
 * change.
 *
 * The Bitcoin Core wallet was originally a collection of unrelated private
 * keys with their associated addresses. If a non-HD wallet generated a
 * key/address, gave that address out and then restored a backup from before
 * that key's generation, then any funds sent to that address would be
 * lost definitively.
 *
 * The keypool was implemented to avoid this scenario (commit: 10384941). The
 * wallet would generate a set of keys (100 by default). When a new public key
 * was required, either to give out as an address or to use in a change output,
 * it would be drawn from the keypool. The keypool would then be topped up to
 * maintain 100 keys. This ensured that as long as the wallet hadn't used more
 * than 100 keys since the previous backup, all funds would be safe, since a
 * restored wallet would be able to scan for all owned addresses.
 *
 * A keypool also allowed encrypted wallets to give out addresses without
 * having to be decrypted to generate a new private key.
 *
 * With the introduction of HD wallets (commit: f1902510), the keypool
 * essentially became an address look-ahead pool. Restoring old backups can no
 * longer definitively lose funds as long as the addresses used were from the
 * wallet's HD seed (since all private keys can be rederived from the seed).
 * However, if many addresses were used since the backup, then the wallet may
 * not know how far ahead in the HD chain to look for its addresses. The
 * keypool is used to implement a 'gap limit'. The keypool maintains a set of
 * keys (by default 1000) ahead of the last used key and scans for the
 * addresses of those keys.  This avoids the risk of not seeing transactions
 * involving the wallet's addresses, or of re-using the same address.
 *
 * The HD-split wallet feature added a second keypool (commit: 02592f4c). There
 * is an external keypool (for addresses to hand out) and an internal keypool
 * (for change addresses).
 *
 * Keypool keys are stored in the wallet/keystore's keymap. The keypool data is
 * stored as sets of indexes in the wallet (setInternalKeyPool,
 * setExternalKeyPool and set_pre_split_keypool), and a map from the key to the
 * index (m_pool_key_to_index). The CKeyPool object is used to
 * serialize/deserialize the pool data to/from the database.
